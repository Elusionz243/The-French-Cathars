              The Cathars were a group of 12th century peoples in southern
              France who were found in each stratum of society and politics.
              They held to a belief system that was deemed heretical by the
              Roman Catholic Church, who sought to convert them back to the
              “true faith”. The inability to identify them through ethnicity,
              race, occupation, or social status created the space and agency
              for them to practice their religion and made it more difficult for
              the church to identify them. Their identity and classification
              have even changed over time. Initially known simply as bons
              hommes, or good men, and alternatively as the Albigenses, “Cathar”
              became the dominant label after the Crusade period. The etymology
              could denote “purity”, something each sought after as part of
              their canon. Their symbol was the yellow cross, an example which
              sits at the middle of this page and remains a symbol along roads
              and highways in the Occitane region of France.

              The church’s effort to convert them back to the tenets of the
              Roman Church escalated from arguments and debates in the late 12th
              century to the twenty-year Albigensian Crusade, starting in 1209.
              Even prior to the crusade, local leaders attempted to protect the
              Cathars, resulting in the demise of their office, standing, and
              land ownership. With the assistance of the kings of France,
              Phillip II and his son, Louis VIII, the northern French nobility
              joined the church’s crusade to root them out and obtain the spoils
              left behind. In addition to political justice waged by the
              warriors, the Dominican order was founded in 2016 to insert the
              church’s justice against the Cathars, as well. The ensuing
              inquisition lasted over 100 years as the Cathars were diminished
              and then flourished again until the final known Cathar was
              executed in 1321.

              The ability for an institution, whether a religious body or
              political, to justify and practice genocide is not isolated to
              this time period. This practice began centuries earlier and
              continues in the present-day. This latter point is why
              understanding the plight of the Cathars, and the general misuse of
              institutional power, can be demonstrative of identifying the
              patterns leading up to similar events. For the historian, they
              give voice and insight to an oppressed culture and demonstrate the
              limit of agency in minimized groups. For the one who applies the
              historians' research in other sciences, the patterns identified
              can act as leading indicators, giving time to influence the local
              people or governments to intervene and deflect the trend.
